# DeMoN: Depth and Motion Network

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**A jupyter-ready, nvidia-docker version of DeMoN without vtk visualization**
**Intended for personal project, thus not a perfect guide**
**Assume you had already installed nvidia-docker in your machine with CUDA enabled**

**This is a folked project from https://github.com/lmb-freiburg/demon**

DeMoN is a ConvNet architecture for solving structure from motion from two views.
It estimates the depth and relative camera motion for pairs of images.
